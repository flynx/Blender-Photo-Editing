# Blender: Photo Editing

Application Template setting up a photo editing workflow


## TODO
- automate file nameing...
  - use loaded image basename  
    -> `<name>.tif` (render)  
    -> `<name>.blend`  

## Nice to have
- tee node -- toggle one of the inputs to output
- ability to export a node control to group  
  e.g. curves interface or a field
